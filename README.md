## üí° Overview

**AutoMate-Client** is the visual interface of the client side in **AutoMate**. This project is based on React implementation. Both the client and server of the system will be deployed locally on your device, you will connect through the local LAN, and you can also choose to deploy the local model to obtain better security. Don't worry about privacy leaks.
